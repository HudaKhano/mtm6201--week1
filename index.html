    <p>Huda Khan is who I am. I'm from Pakistan's Karachi. It been nearly five years in Canada. I was an sports player in Pakistan, participating in basketball and hockey. When I was in school in Pakistan, my friends and I were among the first few girls to play sports and inspired other girls to do the same.

        Since I couldn't find the time to pursue my interest before moving here, my current goals are to learn more, get employment, and build a reliable career. I follow a fairly consistent schedule in order to have a successful career. I go to college, complete my homework, go to work, return home, sleep, and repeat.</p>
